# Tensors.jl
Tensor assignment kernels (optimal sometimes even 5-10x speedup)

Basically most of it just do a very optimal iteration on certain dimensions of the data when it is assigned. 

I have many different function... I tried to give descriptive function name, but all in all it is a chaos... so... you have to check the code what is capable of.
